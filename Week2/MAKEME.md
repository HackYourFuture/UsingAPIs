This part also introduces you to some other concepts `XMLHttpRequest`

## **2. Code along**

In the following "code along" you'll be building a complete Weather App that makes use of the [Darksky API](https://darksky.net).

## **3. Homework exercises**

This week we expect you to do the exercises in the corresponding module/week folder (Using API's / Week 2). Have a look at the [homework guide](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/UsingAPIs/blob/main/hand-in-homework-guide.md) to see how to hand in your homework.

## **4. Interview preparation**

After reading the info on the [‘Interview Preparation’ Repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/interviewpreparation), make a copy of [this file](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/114rTGS4eG6tpkrMAyVIdvgTrnpmkRL6ax_smkw1B0HI/copy) and submit your answers to the team [here](https://hackyourfuture.typeform.com/to/s6zYAugm). These answers will help us assess how ready you are for interviews and we will also discuss your answers in the Career Training Session II which will happen this (or next) week. More information about this session will be shared on Slack!


## **5. Extra: Code along**

If you are done and want to practice some more, the following code along implements a GitHub profile finder using the GitHub API.

He uses some things that will be new for you:
- `scss` - This is what is called a css precompiler that adds some functionality to your css. `sass` is another version of this. Some projects use these, some do not. It is not necessary to know what this does specifically.
- `package.json` commands with the `live server` extension. This is a way to set up a project, don't worry too much about understanding exactly how it works

## Done early?

Have a look at the project for next week and start thinking of ideas. You can even start a bit already if you wish, just remember to make sure all your homework is done beforehand!
