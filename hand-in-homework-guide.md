ONE TIME ONLY (START OF EVERY MODULE)

This module is slightly different as you have already done the one time setup in the previous module. We will be using the same fork as we used there (`https://www.github.com/HackYourHomework/Homework-classXX`).

EVERY WEEK

1. Create a new branch for each week you have homework. For example, for the week 1 homework for Using API's create a branch called `YOUR_NAME-w1-UsingAPIs`
2. Inside the correct week folder, create another folder called `homework`. Make your homework files in there, while on the correct branch
3. Once you're finished, add and commit everything. Make the commit message meaningful, for example `finished project for homework week1`
4. Push the branch to your forked repository
5. On the GitHub page of your forked repository, click on the `create pull request` button. Make sure the `base repository` is your teacher's repository, on branch master
6. Give the pull request a title in the following format:

```markdown
Homework week 1 <Your name>
```

7. Submit the pull request from your forked repository branch into the `master` branch
8. Do a little victory dance because you did it! Good job!
